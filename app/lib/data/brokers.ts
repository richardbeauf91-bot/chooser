      platforms: "Plus500 provides its own proprietary platform on web and mobile. It's designed for simplicity, with clear panels for trade execution, charts, watchlists and P&L. The platform does not support MetaTrader (MT4/MT5) or third-party interfaces. User feedback suggests the platform is generally intuitive, especially for beginners, though some reviews note occasional glitches or limitations in advanced order entry.",
      costs: "Plus500's cost structure primarily includes spreads (the main pricing mechanism on CFDs, commission-free), currency conversion fee (approx. up to 0.70% if quote currency differs from account currency), no deposit fees charged by the broker, and financing costs on leveraged CFD positions held overnight. Overall, trading costs are transparent and competitive for a simple CFD model; however, leverage and financing charges can accumulate on longer-held positions.",
      assetCoverage: "Plus500 offers CFDs on forex pairs, global indices, commodities, share CFDs (hundreds to thousands), and other derivative instruments depending on region. UK clients do not have access to Plus500 Invest (the direct share trading arm); that service is not available to UK residents.",
      customerFeedback: "On UK and global Trustpilot profiles, Plus500's ratings vary widely. Some users report ease of depositing, intuitive design and decent support. However, a substantial number of users also report frustration with customer service, alleged account holds, and withdrawal issues — although these are not verified regulatory complaints and can occur with many online brokers. This mix contributes to an overall widely varied sentiment score in public reviews.",
      costComparison: "Plus500's pricing is typical of a commission-free CFD broker. Spreads only — simplifies cost understanding but requires attention during volatile markets.

      costs: "eToro's fee structure includes multiple components. Commission-free trading on many stocks and ETFs, though there may be small execution fees or flat per-trade charges in some regions. Spreads on forex, CFD and derivative trades vary by asset and are a primary source of cost. Withdrawals typically have a flat fee (e.g., USD 5). Currency conversion fees apply if your account currency differs from trade currency. Inactivity fees are charged if the account is unused after a long period.

Many users find xStation easy to navigate, especially compared with complex third-party platforms.",

Common praise centres on ease of onboarding and clarity of fees, while some users note support responsiveness can vary. Overall feedback suggests XTB is regarded as reliable and stable for retail FX/CFD trading.",

No raw-spread + commission tier like Pepperstone's Razor model — this simplifies costs, though serious high-volume traders might find specialized brokers slightly cheaper.

However, switching between platforms can lead to consistency gaps for some users if not familiar with each.",
      costs: "AvaTrade primarily uses spreads as the core cost mechanism on CFDs. There are no direct commissions on many standard accounts, but variable spreads apply based on market conditions. Financing/overnight charges accrue on leveraged positions held beyond a trading day. Currency conversion fees may apply for trades not in account currency.
